on land.<new>Name the four orders of modern reptiles and give an example of each.<ans>The four surviving groups of reptiles are lizards and snakes (gila moster), crocadilians (alligator), turtles and turtoises, and the tuatara (only living member of the order Sphenodonta).<new>How is excretion carried out in reptiles that live on land?<ans>Reptiles that live on land convert the ammonia in their unrine to uric acid, which is much less toxic , so it doesn't need to be diluted as much. Also excess water is absorbed in the cloaca, reducing the urine to a paste and conserving water.<new>How does a lizard control its body temperature?<ans>A lizard is an ectotherm. To warm up it basks in the sun and to cool down it goes for a swim or lies in the shade.<new>Describe the characteristics of a bird.<ans>Birds are reptile like animals that maintain a constant internal body temperature. They have an outer covering of feathers; two legs that are covered with scales and for walking or perching; and front limbs modified into wings.<new>List three ways in which birds are well adapted for flight.<ans>Birds have a number of adaptations that enable them to fly. These adaptaions include highly efficent digestive, respiratory, and circulatory systems; aerondynamic feathers and wings; strong, lightweight bones; and strong chest muscles.<new>What is the possible evolutionary relationship between birds and dinosaurs?<ans>Some palentologists think that birds evolved directly from dinosaurs. Other fossil evidence leads some researchers to hypothesize that birds and dinosaurs both eolved from an earlier common ancestor.<new>How does a chick get out of its eggshell?<ans>when a chick is ready to hatch, it uses a small tooth on its bill to make a hole in the shell. After much pushing, poking, and prodding by the chick, the eggshell breaks open.<new>Which adaptation is not a characteristic of reptiles?<ans>gills<new>Dinosaurs became extinct at the end of the _____ period.<ans>Cretaceous<new>An animal that relies on interaction with the environment to help it control body temperature is known as ______.<ans>ectotherm.<new>Which reptiles have some type of shell covering their bodies?<ans>turles and tortoises<new>The single most important characteristic that seperates birds from other living animals is the presence of ______.<ans>feathers<new>As a reptile grows what happens to its skin?<ans>The skin is shed periodically as the size of the reptile increases<new>What climate conditions prevailed at the end of the Carboniferous Period? How did these conditions affect the evolution of reptiles?<ans>At the end of the carboniferous period, the climate of the Earth became cooler and less humid. Reptiles are better adapted than amphibians to survive in a drier climate, so a great adaptive radiation of reptiles began.<new>What conditions may have caused the mass extinction of the dinosaurs?<ans>There are many theories as to why the mass extinction of dinosaurs occured. One hypothesis explains that a string of massive volcanic eruptions, lava flows, a drop in sea level and a huge asteroid or comet collision occurred in the Yucatan Peninsula during the Cretaceous Period. The asteroid would have produced enormous amounts of dust clouds and forest fires such that within a few million years, the dinosaurs and any other anima or plant groups, became extinct.<new>In what ways do interactions with the environment affect the body temperatures of reptiles?<ans>Interactions with the environment help animals to control their body temperature. As a reptile begins to cool down, they may more toward warmer areas, such as sunlight. If their boy becomes to hot, they may move to a cooler environment like the shade.<new>If a bird has a short, thich bill, what does it probably feed on?<ans>seeds<new>Descibe how a bird's skeletal system is adapted in ways that enable flight.<ans>Fused b ones provide sturdy attachments for muscles.
