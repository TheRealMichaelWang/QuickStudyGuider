prop.name<ans>AMGEN Biotechnology Experience Key<new>prop.author<ans>MICHAEL WANG<new>prop.info<ans>This key covers some questions for your AMGEN Biotechnology questions.<new>What is cloning?<ans>The process of producing similar populations of genetically identical individuals that occurs in nature when organisms such as bacteria, insects, plants or animals reproduce asexually.<new>Do you think that treating diabetes with insulin can be considered a cure? What is the difference between a treatment and a cure?<ans>Treating diabetes with insulin is not a cure. A cure helps get rid of the disease altogether. Whereas a treatment helps keep the disease under control.<new>Why might diabetes be on the rise, especially in teenagers?<ans>Diabetes has gradually become a very serious problem among many American teenagers because, teens are more likely to consume diabetes causing foods than any other age group.<new>What does the term genetic disease mean? What examples of genetic diseases do you know about?<ans>A genetic disorder is a genetic problem caused by one or more abnormalities in the genome. Down syndrome, Sickle cell amnesia, and Huntington's disease are all genetic disorders.<new>Adding human DNA to bacteria makes it possible to make human insulin. What do you already know about DNA? Be as detailed as possible and discuss the location of DNA in the cell, DNA structure, the replication of DNA, and the components of DNA.<ans>- Location of DNA in cell: eukaryote 
-DNa found in chromosomes of nucleus and in mitochondria and chloroplasts
- Prokayote: DNA found in a chromosome in the nucleoid and in plasmids<new>Why do you think it is necessary to use very small and exact volumes of reagents in biotechnology?<ans>To ensure that the experiment/procedure would be successful.<new>When loading or dispensing a solution, why is it important to actually see the solution enter or leave the pipette tip?<ans>The amounts are so small that it is easy to become confused and do the steps in the wrong order or miss a step, so it is important to check that the solution enters and leaves the tip as you need it to. If a reagent is missing, an entire experiment can be invalid.<new>You were instructed to avoid contact with the pipette tips—for example, you were asked to put the pipette tip on without using your hands, to avoid setting down the micropipette, to use the ejector button to remove the tip, and to keep the tip box closed. If you were working with plasmids and bacterial cells, why would these precautions be important?<ans>For two reasons. Firstly, the tips and all surfaces need to remain clean so that the plasmids and bacterial cells do not get contaminated with other substances. Secondly, you also do not want contaminate yourself or surfaces with bacterial cells.<new>In what circumstances might it be important to use gel electrophoresis to separate and identify plasmids and short linear pieces of DNA?<ans>This would be important if you are making a recombinant plasmid and have to verify that you have been successful.<new>Which solution sample contained a single dye: S1, S2, or S3? How do you know?<ans>S3 contained a single dye because it only had one band.<new>What electrical charge do the dyes have? Explain your reasoning.<ans>They must be negatively charged, because when they are put into the wells of an agarose gel in an electric field they are repelled by the negative electrode and attracted to the positive electrode. You can see them migrating towards the positive electrode.<new>The dyes that you are separating are orange G (yellow), bromophenol blue (purple), and xylene cyanole (blue). If the molecular shape and electric charge of all three dyes are similar, what is the order of the dyes from heaviest to lightest molecules, based on your initial results? Why do you think this is the correct order?<ans>From heaviest to lightest: Xylene cyanole, bromophenol blue, orange G. 
This order is based on the appearance of the color bands in the agarose gel after running the electrophoresis box—the light blue xylene cyanol is closest to the wells, the purple bromophenol blue is next closest, and the yellow/orange coloured orange G dye moved the farthest from the wells.<new>What is the importance of micropipettes and gel electrophoresis in genetic engineering?<ans>Micropipettes are important in genetic engineering to be precise and fill up wells in genetic electrophoresis. Gel electrophoresis separates DNA and makes it easier to analyze based on size and charge.<new>How are recombinant plasmids used to treat genetic diseases?<ans>Recombinant plasmids give people necessary medicine like insulin, which is helpful to people with diabetes, and it reduces the price of health care.<new>What is the structure and function of DNA? Describe in words or a drawing the structure of a DNA molecule. Be as detailed as possible.<ans>DNA is a double-stranded molecule, and each strand is made up of nucleotides. There are four different nucleotides, which are distinguished by a subpart called a base. The bases are cytosine, guanine, adenine, and thymine. The two strands of DNA are connected by hydrogen bonds between adjacent bases, which are called base pairs. In the base pairs, cytosine is always paired with guanine, and adenine is always paired with thymine.<new>All living organisms contain DNA. In what ways is DNA from different organisms the same, and in what ways does it vary?<ans>All DNA has the same structure and uses the same code and transcription and translation processes. Among different organisms, the DNA sequences will vary because the organisms make different proteins.<new>Using your understanding of genes and how they are expressed, explain why it is possible for a bacterial cell to make a human protein from the instructions encoded in a human gene.<ans>Because the DNA in all organisms uses the same code and transcription and translation processes, the bacterial cell can create a human protein from a human gene. 
-DNA IS UNIVERSAL<new>How do bacteria that carry a restriction enzyme avoid cutting up their own DNA?<ans>The recognition sequence does not exist in bacterial DNA. Thus, restriction enzymes in bacteria are unable to cut up their own DNA.<new>What is the sequence of the sticky end that results when DNA is cut with BamHI? With HindIII?<ans>HindIII - AGCT 
BamHI - GATC<new>Scientists can modify plasmids to have a single restriction enzyme site. Imagine that you have a plasmid with a single EcoRI site. Draw the structure of the plasmid after it has been cut with the enzyme, and show the nucleotide sequences left at the site of the cut. If you wanted to insert a gene from a plant at this site, what enzyme would you use to cut the plant DNA with? Explain your response.<ans>3' - CTTAAG 
5' - GAATTC<new>Why is it important that the same enzyme or enzymes be used to cut both the plasmid and the insulin gene from the human DNA?<ans>it is important to use the same enzyme so that both the ends of the insulin and plasmid connect.<new>Which antibiotic would you use to determine if the recombinant DNA was taken in?<ans>Kanamycin.<new>Why does using two different enzymes to cut the plasmid prevent the plasmid from reforming a circle without the inserted gene?<ans>Each restriction enzyme cuts DNA at a specific recognition site. HindIII cuts it at AGCT and BamHI cuts it at TCGA. Using these two different restriction enzymes results in unmatched sticky ends on either end of each fragment. Since the two ends of the same fragment can't join together anymore, they are forced to match up with the other fragment.<new>If pARA-R is digested with BamHI and HindIII, what fragments are produced? Record the nucleotide sequence of the sticky ends and the length of each fragment (bp), and indicate the genes and other important sequences present on each fragment.<ans>Two fragments are produced. RFP with pBAD & Ara-C with Ori with Amp-R. The RFP + pBAD = 807 BP. Ara-C, Ori and Amp-R = 4495 BP<new>In order to create a plasmid that can produce the red uorescent protein in bacteria, what components are needed in the plasmid?<ans>Important features of the plasmid are .... 
 (1) a sequence for the initiation of DNA replication, which
allows the plasmid to replicate in the bacteria (ori) 
(2) a promoter sequence for initiating
transcription of the inserted gene (pBAD) 
 (3) the gene of interest (rfp) 
(4) a gene encoding a protein for antibiotic resistance, which allows for identification of bacteria that have taken in the
plasmid (kanR / ampR).<new>Bacteria can be killed by an antibiotic unless they carry a plasmid that has the gene for resistance to that antibiotic. Biotechnologists call these genes selectable markers because only bacteria that carry the gene will survive an antibiotic. If the uptake of DNA by bacteria is inef cient (as discussed in the reading), why is a selectable marker critical in cloning a gene in bacteria?<ans>You want to know which bacterial cells contain the recombinant plasmid and can make the protein
you wish to obtain. The selectable marker will allow you to kill off the bacteria that do not have the
plasmid with the gene of interest by growing all bacteria on nutrient agar containing an antibiotic.
Only those with the plasmid will be resistant and survive.<new>In this step, you are asked to set up a tube without the restriction enzymes, BamHI and HindIII. What is the purpose of this step, and why is it important?<ans>The tubes without the enzymes are controls. We can compare a control with the tube that has the
enzymes in order to compare the uncut plasmid with the cut plasmid. The control will indicate if for
some reason the enzymes did not work as expected, as both the control tube and the tube with the
enzymes will give the same result when examined by gel electrophoresis.<new>Why might the enzymes work best at 37°C? Why should the enzymes then be placed in the freezer? (Hint: The human body temperature is 37°C.)<ans>The enzymes originally came from bacteria that are at human body temperature and are designed to work at this temperature. Placing the enzymes in the freezer will stop the enzymes from losing
activity.<new>List in words or indicate in a drawing the important features of a plasmid vector that are required to clone a gene. Explain the purpose of each feature.<ans>Ori - orgin of replication. 
RFP - red fluorescent protein . 
Amp-R - selectable marker. 
Ara-C - binds promoter together so we can get the transcription of gene interest.<new>What role do restriction enzymes have in nature?<ans>They protect the bacteria from infection by bacteriophage (viruses that infect bacteria)<new>Using your understanding of evolution, why would bacteria retain a gene that gives them resistance to antibiotics? How is the existence of bacteria with antibiotic resistance affecting medicine today?<ans>Bacteria retain genes that give them resistance to antibiotics to protect themselves from disease because only the ones that survive the antibiotics replicate. The medical fields constantly have to create new antibiotics because the old antibiotics have selected for the bacteria with resistance to the antibiotics.<new>Bacteria, sea anemones, and humans seem, on the surface, to be very different organisms. Explain how a gene from humans or a sea anemone can be expressed in bacteria to make a product never before made in bacteria.<ans>Central dogma, which is DNA to mRna to protein, is the reason human genes can be expressed in bacteria. The code of life is universal.<new>Due to a mishap in the lab, bacteria carrying a plasmid with an ampicillin- resistant gene and bacteria carrying a plasmid with a gene that provides resistance to another antibiotic (kanamycin) were accidentally mixed together. Design an experiment that will allow you to sort out the two kinds of bacteria. (Hint: Make sure that you do not kill off one of the kinds of bacteria you are trying to sort out!)<ans>Split the original petri dish into two petri dishes. Put the ampicillin in one and the kanamycin in the other, and it result in one petri dish that has killed off all the ampicillin sensitive cells, but kept the ampicillin resistant cells. Vise versa for the kanamycin sensitive cells in the other petri dish.<new>Why do DNA restriction fragments and plasmids separate when analyzed by gel electrophoresis?<ans>They separate because they have different charges and sizes. Separation occurs during the procedure because lighter and more compact molecules move faster than heavier and less compact molecules.The DNA molecules, including fragments and plasmids, move through the gel during the procedure of gel electrophoresis. Separation occurs during the procedure because lighter and more compact molecules move faster than heavier and less compact molecules.<new>Why is it important to identify and verify a recombinant plasmid?<ans>It is important to verify your plasmid to make sure... 
 - that it is the size you expect it to be 
 - that the restriction enzymes cut the DNA where you expected it to. 
 - that correct fragment size resulted from the restriction. If the plasmids or the fragments are the wrong size it could indication you have the wrong plasmid, and if you have the wrong plasmid you will not get rfp.<new>After different DNA fragments and plasmids have been separated by gel electrophoresis, the gel is stained to show bands that indicate the location of each kind of fragment and plasmid. The drawing of a stained gel below shows a series of bands that have been labeled with letters. The locations of the wells are also shown. What is the order of the fragments, from smallest to largest?<ans>The order of fragments from smallest to largest is B, G, D, F, A, C, and E.<new>If you used gel electrophoresis to separate the same plasmid that has all three con gurations, the supercoiled plasmid would move the fastest, while the multimer would move the slowest. Why do the different plasmid con gurations move the way they do through the gel? Explain in words or a drawing.<ans>The supercoiled and nicked circle plasmids have the same molecular weight, but the supercoiled
plasmid moves more quickly through the gel because it takes up less space for its size and therefore
can move through the spaces in the gel more quickly. The multimer is very slow because it has
multiple copies of the plasmid and therefore has a much greater molecular weight.<new>The pARA-R plasmid you digested in Laboratory 2A was replicated in a bacterial cell. What con gurations—supercoiled, nicked circle, and multimer—might the plasmid have before digestion?<ans>The two plasmids can have all three configurations<new>You need to catalog all the products you might see, including the different plasmid con gurations. Review your work in Laboratory 2A. What products might you expect to see in the R- and R+ tubes? Create a table that shows all the possible fragments and plasmids by tube. Include the length (bp size) of each possible fragment or plasmid, and arrange the products found in each microfuge tube by size, from smallest to largest. Include any possible plasmid con gurations, and arrange them rst by size and next by speed through the gel, from fastest to slowest.<ans>Tubes

RFP-pBAD: 807 BP
Amp-R,Ori, Ara-C: 4,495 BP<new>The DNA is not visible as it moves through the gel. The loading dye contains the three dyes that you separated in Laboratory 1.2. Why is it useful to use the loading dye in this lab?<ans>So we could see the DNA move from one side to the other on the gel.<new>The DNA samples and the DNA ladder are not visible on the gel. How might the DNA be made visible once the gel electrophoresis is complete?<ans>You could shine UV light through the DNA and the dye will illuminate.<new>Why is it important to verify that you have the correct recombinant plasmid?<ans>-error during procedure/other problems may occur 
-reagents may not be correct
-products of genetic engineering are not visible-mistake will go unnoticed. 
-must ensure recombinant plasmid that has desired gene/important gene sequences<new>Do you see any bands that are not expected? What could explain the origin of these unexpected bands?<ans>Yes, there were some unexpected bands. I believe this is a result of human error or it could have resulted when the plasmid was being digested.<new>Does the gel show that you are using the correct recombinant plasmid?<ans>Yes, the gel shows that the R+ lane has 2 bands.<new>In the R- lane, do you see evidence of multiple configurations of plasmids? Explain your answer.<ans>In the R- lane, I saw evidence of multiple configurations of plasmids because the plasmids have not developed into a nicked circle.<new>In the R+ lane, do you see evidence of complete digestion? Explain your answer.<ans>The plasmid was digested and made into multiple parts unlike linear DNA which only has 1 band.<new>Compare the lanes that have linear fragments with the lanes that have plasmids. Is there a difference in the shape of the bands between these two DNA forms?<ans>The bands are further apart???<new>Do you think that bacterial uptake of a plasmid from the environment is a common event? Why or why not?<ans>It is not common because bacteria has cell walls which help avoid plasmids from entering.<new>What is the relationship among genes, proteins, and traits (or observable characteristics)?<ans>DNA helps the cell work properly. The protein in the cell and body codes for traits.<new>What do bacteria and humans have in common that makes it possible for a human gene to be expressed in bacteria?<ans>Humans have the same DNA structure and coding as bacteria. The cell coding carries out transcription and translation which allows a human gene to be expressed as bacteria. DNA IS UNIVERSAL.<new>Once a gene has been inserted into a vector, what do you think is required to make the product encoded by the inserted gene?<ans>Transcription and translation are required to make the product encoded by the inserted gene.<new>Why is it important that the membranes of E. coli bacteria carefully regulate which substances can enter and exit the cell?<ans>To ensure no harmful contaminates or substances enter the membrane of the cell.<new>Ampicillin is an antibiotic that kills bacterial cells by disrupting the formation of cell walls. However, the pARA-R plasmid has the ampicillin resistance gene, which produces a protein that breaks down ampicillin. What is the purpose of growing bacteria that have been transformed in the presence of ampicillin?<ans>The purpose of growing these bacteria is it separates those with the resistance from those without it.<new>What will happen when bacterial cells that contain the pARA-R plasmid are not given arabinose?<ans>If the bacterial cells are not given arabinose, then the pARA-R plasmid will not turn on the promoter. Then the protein will not turn red.

 Without arabinose the RFP gene will not be expressed so there will be no red glow.<new>In the lab, you will add samples of the control group P- and the treatment group P+ to plates that contain various combinations of Luria Broth (LB), ampicillin, and the sugar arabinose. The plates will be arranged as follows: P+
Show your predictions for the growth you would expect for each combination.<ans>Non-Transformed Bacteria.

Luria Broth ampicillin (LB/amp) = -

Transformed Bacteria
Luria Broth (LB) =. +
Luria Broth ampicillin (LB/amp) = -
Luria Broth ampicillin arabinose (LB/amp/ara)= +++<new>How is the P+ bacteria culture treated differently from the P- bacteria culture? (A culture is an isolated population of cells.) What is the purpose of the P- bacteria culture?<ans>The P+ is treated differently in that is must be kept separate from the P-. The P- is there t prove that the ampicillin will kill the P- bacteria but not the P+ bacteria. In additionThe P+ culture was given a DNA plasmid, while the P- culture was not..<new>Why do the cells need time to recover after the heat shock?<ans>So they do not overheat and die.<new>Why are the cells incubated at 37°C?<ans>Because that is the human body temperature at which cells grow best.<new>You used aseptic technique in this lab. Why is this important?<ans>It helps us to not cross contaminate the P+ and P- bacteria.<new>Look at the results of your transformation. Do your actual results match your predicted results? If not, what differences do you see, and what are some explanations for these differences?<ans>No, our results did not match our predicted results because our experiment was not a success. We were unsuccessful in transforming the bacteria. This is because of an error in temperature. Since we set the temperature to a higher temperature; our cells did not stay cold enough, making them unable to take in plasmids. (incompetent)<new>How many red colonies were present on your LB/amp/ara plate?<ans>None, our experiment was unsuccessful.<new>Why did the red colonies only appear on the LB/amp/ara plate and not the LB/amp plate?<ans>Both have "transformed" colonies but in order to make the red fluorescent protein, arabinose needs to be present in order to bind to the araC protein which then allows for the binding of RNA polymerase to Pbad.<new>Recombinant plasmids are engineered so that they can replicate in the cell independently of the chromosome replication. Why is it important to have multiple copies of a recombinant plasmid within a cell?<ans>It is so there is extra for cell growth and in case of failure during transcription.<new>How is the information encoded in the rfp gene expressed as a trait? Be sure to use what you have previously learned about gene expression and the relationship between DNA, RNA, protein, and traits.<ans>The expression happens when the DNA is transcribed into protein using the central dogma DNA to mRNA to Protein.<new>Why is it possible for bacteria to make a human protein, such as insulin, or a sea anemone protein, such as the red fluorescent protein?<ans>All genes have the same central dogma (DNA to mRNA to Protein), so they can be expressed in seemingly different organisms.<new>The do's and dont's of how to handle a pipette<ans>DO'S 
- always use a tip
- push to first stop before placing tip in liquid
push to second stop to expel liquid

DONT'S
- don't push air into liquid
- don't snap plunger back.
don't turn pipette horizontally when there is liquid inside.
- do not exceed range.<new>In what ways is DNA from different organisms the same, and in what ways does it vary?<ans>All DNA has the same structure and uses the same code and transcription and translation processes. Among different organisms, the DNA sequences will vary because the organisms make different proteins.<new>Why do DNA restriction fragments and plasmids separate when analyzed by gel electrophoresis?<ans>They separate because they have different charges and sizes. Separation occurs during the procedure because lighter and more compact molecules move faster than heavier and less compact molecules. The DNA molecules, including fragments and plasmids, move through the gel during the procedure of gel electrophoresis. Separation occurs during the procedure because lighter and more compact molecules move faster than heavier and less compact molecules.<new>what would the window of a micropipette ( P-20) look like if you dialed 6.3ul?
